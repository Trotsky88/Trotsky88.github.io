            <p id = "center">This is my website it is currently under construction more to come.

             <p class = "col-md-4">This is me, I was born and raised in Seattle Washington and lived there until four years ago when I moved out to Montana for college. From an early age, I always had a fascination with computers and circuits. It started around when I was eight, I would collect broken electronics from my neighbors so I could take them apart to see how they worked. This evolved into me having a greater appreciation for computers and as I got older I moved towards programming and putting together electrics instead of taking them apart. It wasnâ€™t until college when I was fully able to invest my time towards computers and programming. Now computers are a huge part of my life but like when I was eight I am always eager to learn more about them.</p>

                <p class = "text-left">In my spare time I enjoy buying parts offline and putting together drones and computers. When I was little friends and family members would give me broken electronics and I would love to take them apart to see what was inside and try to figure out how it worked. So it was only natural once I got a better understanding of computers that I started to build them on my own.</p>

                <p class = "text-left">For my first two years of college I played for the Montana State ultimate frisbee team. We traveled all over the mid west to play all sorts of college teams. Unfortunately I had to drop out of the team when I broke my arm my Sophmore year.</p>

                <p class = "text-left">During my Sophmore year of college I was given the opportunity to start the Iota Epsilon chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi out at Montana State. This was a lot of fun and gave me the opportunity to become more involved with the school and Bozeman as a whole. During my three years in the fraternity I was given the roles of Director of Philanthropy and Director of Fundraising. These positions helped me learn how to raise and manage money as well as what the best forms of comunity service are for your local comunity.</p>

                <p class = "text-left">Since I can remeber I have been hitting the slopes to go skiing. During my middle school years I tried to pick up snowboarding to try something new. However I quickly found that it was not for me and switched back to skiing. It was only natural for me to move out to Bozeman for college with how good the skiing is out here.</p>

                <p class = "text-left">When I was young I joind Cub Scouts and then eventually moved onto Boy Scouts. Being a part of these organizations Gave me a great appreciation for the outdoors. We would gho to places all over Washington. My favorite trip would be our alternating 50 mile trip. During these trips we would alternate between a backpacking trip and a canoeing trip. Still to this day I try to get out for a good hike or camping trip with my buddies. </p>
